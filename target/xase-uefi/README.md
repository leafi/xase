# xase UEFI boot-o-tron

Currently built using the TianoCore EDK II.

(Application is simple enough that this could probably be ported
to gnu-efi with little trouble. Just watch the calling conventions,
eh?)

How to build? This folder contains the .c and .inf for https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Getting-Started-Writing-Simple-Application .

(TODO: Lua!!!)
